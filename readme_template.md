# Description

Planning to add a lot of my own solution and explaination on fun LeetCode questions here. Please stay tune. 👏👏👏

Sad that I have to "paginate" things out. Apparently Github don't do rendering on markdown file with 2000+ table rows. 🙁

Take the below few steps and you may produce this nice content page along with all the sub-tables!!

1. Clone this repo and run `git checkout starting-point` to start things from scratch.
2. Login LeetCode and retrieve the required cookie. Put this into `.env` file.
```console
cookie=...
```
3. Start the main script.
```shell
$ nvm use
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
